Create a simple business website that consists of the following pages: Home, Contact, Browse, and View Products. From each page, there will be a header and a footer. The footer will include a copyright with '2015', and the header will include a 'logo' that reads 'Business Site' along with links the user will be able to click on to navigate between the different pages. The home page will consist of a message to welcome the user, as well as a smaller message asking if the user would like to browse products, with the word 'products' being a link to the browse page. From the browse page, the user will see three links of products he/she can click on. Once clicked, the user will be provided a message that reads "You chose the {{product name}}". The contact page will include a name, phone number, and email for the user to contact the business.
